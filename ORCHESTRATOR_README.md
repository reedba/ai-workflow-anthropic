    priority: int
    status: TaskStatus
    # ... additional fields
```

#### **Worker Implementation**
```python
class AIWorker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id: str, worker_type: WorkerType):
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        self.worker_type = worker_type
        self.is_busy = False
    
    def process_task(self, task: Task) -> Task:
        # Specialized AI processing
```
